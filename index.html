      <h1>Mariasole Alossa</h1>
      <h2>"Web Developer"</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">After working in the tourist industry and getting a degree in Study of Religions (focused on post-modernism, gender and post-colonial studies), two years ago I started working for an NGO in Ranong, a small town in Thailand on the border with Myanmar. There I found a community and family to be a part of, but I felt that my teaching English and Social Studies wasn't enough. So I decided to take the plunge and finally learn coding, after planning it and putting it off since 2013. In one or two years I hope I can return to Ranong and bring coding and better tech education to the Thai-Myanmar border areas and the many Burmese immigrant children who live there.</p>
